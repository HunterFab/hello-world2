# Hello, JavaScript!

You remember Hello, HTML!, right? Well, this is Hello, JavaScript! You'll be adding to your existing `hello-world` repository and giving that once rather dull website a little interaction.

## Getting Started

There's not a whole lot of setup required for this one. You should already have a local and remote `hello-world` repository.

## Requirements

Modify your `hello-world` website from September and add some interaction. In total, you should end up with 4 buttons on your website. Each button will perform a slightly different action. Likewise, your JavaScript file should contain 4 functions that correspond to the 4 buttons (afterall, what do you think is driving the action?).

More specifically, your modifications should meet the following specifications.

* A button whose text reads `Hello, Console` that, when clicked, will print `Hello, World!` to the console.
   - You'll need to figure out where the console is and how you open it!
* A button whose text reads `Hello, Pop-up` that, when clicked, displays a pop-up window that say `Hello, World!`.
* A button whose text reads `Hello, Browser` that, when clicked, generates the HTML necessary to render `Hello, World!` on the page.
   - The text should be rendered below the the button that was clicked.
* A button whose text reads `Hello, Stranger` that, when clicked, does 2 things:
   - First, it should prompt the user to enter his or her name (hint: there's a built-in function called `prompt`).
   - Second, it should display a greeting to the user (i.e., using the name he or she entered).
      * This can be done in the console, as a pop-up, or in the browser.

## Deadline

Your Canvas submission is due at or before 11:59pm tonight.
* November 6, 2018 (A 3/4 & 7/8)
* November 7, 2018 (B 3/4 & 7/8)

### Submission Requirements

All that is required for submission is the top-level URL to your [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository (i.e., your `hello-world` repository URL).
